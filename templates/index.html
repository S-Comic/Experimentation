<p>I'm Samuel Jule, a year 12 student currently studying for A-Levels at Hautlieu.
As you can probably tell by the website, I'm hugely into coding, electronics ,and anything
even remotely technology related. I'm proficient in python, CSS and HTML, and I'm learning
Javascript to further my knowledge. I've learnt these languages by working on projects in my
own time, and by collaborating with others. Whenever I have free time, I'll have an IDE open.</P>

<h3>Personal Projects</h3>

<p>I often experiment with my free time, and complete some personal projects to further my skills.</p>

  and the internals were assembled during the event. We achieved third place in the Hackathon.</p>

<p>- I custom built my own desktop computer, and aided in the building of three other computers.</p>
